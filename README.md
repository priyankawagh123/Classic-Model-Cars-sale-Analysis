# Power-Bi-Dashboard
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of a fictional company that sells collectible classic model cars. The dataset consists of eight interrelated tables covering customers, employees, offices, orders, payments, products, and product lines.

# Data Sources

This project uses 8 core tables:

1. **Customers** – Information about customers and their sales representatives  
2. **Employees** – Employee details including job titles and reporting hierarchy  
3. **Offices** – Office locations for the company  
4. **Orders** – Sales order details by date and status  
5. **Order Details** – Line-level sales records for each order  
6. **Payments** – Payments made by customers over time  
7. **Product Lines** – Description of product categories  
8. **Products** – Detailed product catalog with pricing and stock levels  

# Key Insights
- Top Performing Products:

 Classic Cars generated the highest revenue, followed by Vintage Cars and Motorcycles.

 High-margin products are not always top sellers—volume and price mix are crucial.

- Customer Segmentation:

 Customers from the USA and France dominate total payments.

 A small percentage of customers contribute a large portion of total revenue (Pareto principle).

- Payment & Credit Analysis:

 Some customers exceed 80% of their credit limit, indicating potential credit risk.

 Payment delays are minimal; most customers make timely payments.

- Order Trends:

 Peak order volume occurs in Q1 and Q4 of the year, suggesting seasonal demand.

 Majority of orders are shipped within 5–7 days of order placement.

- Sales Rep & Office Performance:

 The San Francisco office leads in overall revenue.

 Sales reps under VP Sales consistently outperform others, indicating effective leadership.

- Inventory Overview:

 Some products (e.g., 1968 Ford Mustang) are nearly out of stock, requiring urgent restock.

 High stock items with low sales volume suggest overstock or poor demand.

# Why This Project Stands Out

1. **End-to-End Pipeline** – From data cleaning and transformation to modeling and dashboarding  
2. **Relational Data Modeling** – Uses proper relationships and cardinality for scalable BI models  
3. **Business-Driven Approach** – Focused on real-world use cases and decisions  
4. **Advanced DAX Usage** – Includes calculated measures, KPIs, and filters  
5. **Interactive Dashboard** – User-friendly visuals with slicers, tooltips, and drill-throughs  
6. **Professional Documentation** – Organized structure with a README and screenshots
