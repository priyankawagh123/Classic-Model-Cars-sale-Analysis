# 🚀📊 Power-Bi-Dashboard
# 🚗 Classic Car Sales Analysis Project
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of a fictional company that sells collectible classic model cars. The dataset consists of eight interrelated tables covering customers, employees, offices, orders, payments, products, and product lines.

# Key Insights
1. 📈 Top Performing Products:

 - Classic Cars generated the highest revenue, followed by Vintage Cars and Motorcycles.

 - High-margin products are not always top sellers—volume and price mix are crucial.

2. 👥🔍Customer Segmentation:

 - Customers from the USA and France dominate total payments.

 - A small percentage of customers contribute a large portion of total revenue (Pareto principle).

3. 💳🏦Payment & Credit Analysis:

 - Some customers exceed 80% of their credit limit, indicating potential credit risk.

 - Payment delays are minimal; most customers make timely payments.

4. 📅🚚Order Trends:

 - Peak order volume occurs in Q1 and Q4 of the year, suggesting seasonal demand.

 - Majority of orders are shipped within 5–7 days of order placement.

5. 🏆🎯Sales Rep & Office Performance:

 - The San Francisco office leads in overall revenue.

 - Sales reps under VP Sales consistently outperform others, indicating effective leadership.

6. 🔍📋Inventory Overview:

 - Some products (e.g., 1968 Ford Mustang) are nearly out of stock, requiring urgent restock.

 - High stock items with low sales volume suggest overstock or poor demand.

 # Key Features
📌 Interactive Filters & Slicers

- Analyze by product line, customer, country, or sales rep dynamically.

📈 Visual Dashboards

- KPIs, bar charts, line graphs, and donut charts for at-a-glance insights.

📊 DAX Measures

- Custom calculations like total revenue, profit margin, top N customers/products.

🛠 Data Model

- Star schema using relationships between fact and dimension tables.

🔍 Drill-through & Tooltips

- Explore individual customer, product, or order details with a click.

📅 Time Intelligence

- Monthly, quarterly, and yearly comparisons using date hierarchy.

✅ Clean Data Pipeline

- Null value handling, data type correction, and column renaming in Power Query.

# Why This Project Stands Out

1. **End-to-End Pipeline** – From data cleaning and transformation to modeling and dashboarding  
2. **Relational Data Modeling** – Uses proper relationships and cardinality for scalable BI models  
3. **Business-Driven Approach** – Focused on real-world use cases and decisions  
4. **Advanced DAX Usage** – Includes calculated measures, KPIs, and filters  
5. **Interactive Dashboard** – User-friendly visuals with slicers, tooltips, and drill-throughs  
6. **Professional Documentation** – Organized structure with a README and screenshots
